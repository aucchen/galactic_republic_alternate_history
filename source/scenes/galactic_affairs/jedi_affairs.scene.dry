= Jedi Affairs

The Jedi are currently the closest thing the Republic has to an army, a quasi-religious order of warriors with mystical super-physical powers. Their interests do not always coincide with the common good of the Republic, but they have a good working relation with the Senate, and thus the Chancellor.
